  <speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2014-02-24a.711.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100298" speakername="Baroness Hollis of Heigham" colon=":" colnum="711"  time="015:07:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0001.htm#st_66">
  	<p pid="a.711.0/1">I am grateful for the tolerance of the House in allowing me to delay speaking for a moment or two while noble Lords are leaving the Chamber. They are clearly underwhelmed by the issue that we are about to debate.</p>
  	<p pid="a.711.0/2">I strongly welcome the new state pension. Pensions are attached to the waged labour market. Only one job in four created since 2008 is, according to the Work Foundation, permanent; 1 million or more are zero-hours contracts with no certainty of any work at all. Hundreds of thousands of others are short-hours contracts and, along with other non-standard employment patterns such as term-time working, job sharing and so on, comprise 40% of all jobs&#8212;I repeat, 40%&#8212;as employers seek to match a flexible and irregular labour force to flexible and irregular demand.</p>
  	<p pid="a.711.0/3">Part-time work and flexible work may suit, and does suit, many women, students or older people on a pension. Those jobs are in cleaning, catering, domiciliary care&#8212;involving 150,000 people&#8212;hotel and retail, and are usually paid at around minimum wage level. Very many of those people will not be building a state pension. Our pension structure, both state and private, has not yet caught up. It is 10 or 15 years behind as the plates shift in the labour market.</p>
  	<p pid="a.711.0/4">This amendment, which is permissive, seeks to put a pension floor under workers who may work in several mini-jobs and put in quite long hours&#8212;30 or so a week&#8212;but who cannot, under rules set out decades ago, build themselves a new state pension. If they are in one job with sufficient pay they will build a state pension, but if they are in several jobs with identical pay they do not. If your Lordships agree today we can begin to do something about it.</p>
  	<p pid="a.711.0/5">Under Governments of both parties we have sought to credit people into the national insurance system for a state pension where, for good reason, people are not in waged work. They include mothers of young children, disabled people and carers. Universal credit, which I strongly support, will credit another 0.8 million people into national insurance, I understand.</p>
