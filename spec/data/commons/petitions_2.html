The Government’s policy is not to interfere with the jurisdiction of a local planning authority unless it is necessary to do so. This is because local authority councillors are elected to represent the views of local people and, in the main, it is these councillors who are in the best position to decide whether a development should go ahead. It is, of course, for local planning authorities to provide whatever justification it may be appropriate to give for their decisions and procedures.</p><p><a class="anchor" name="stpa_336"> </a><a class="anchor" name="140212p0001.htm_para7"> </a><a class="anchor" name="140212174000013"> </a>In determining a planning application, the local planning authority, who have full knowledge of the local circumstances, are required to have regard to all material considerations including the development plan, national policies and views expressed by third parties.</p><a class="anchor-column noCont" name="column_8P"> </a><p><b>12 Feb 2014 : Column 8P</b></p><p><a class="anchor" name="stpa_337"> </a><a class="anchor" name="140212p0001.htm_para8"> </a><a class="anchor" name="140212174000014"> </a>The Secretary of State might decide to call in the application for his own determination if he considers that it raises matters of more than local importance, but his policy is to be very selective about this.
