It could lead to suppliers increasing prices before the freeze comes in to protect themselves against unpredictable hikes in the price companies pay for energy on commodity markets during the period of the freeze.</p><p><a class="anchor" name="stpa_273"> </a><a class="anchor" name="140116p0001.htm_para10"> </a><a class="anchor" name="14011655000016"> </a>We know rising energy prices are hitting many households hard at a difficult time. While the Government cannot control the price of energy in the global market, they can help bill payers by reducing the impact of social and environmental programmes on their bills. The Government have recently announced proposals that will allow energy companies to reduce the bills of British households by £50 on average, helping to reduce the impact of recent price rises. This builds on the help given to hard-working people through income tax cuts, the council tax freeze and the fuel duty freeze.</p><p><a class="anchor" name="stpa_274"> </a><a class="anchor" name="140116p0001.htm_para11"> </a><a class="anchor" name="14011655000017"> </a>On 2 December the Government confirmed they will reduce the current cost of levies by:</p><a class="anchor" name="14011655000026"> </a><p class="tabletext">Establishing a rebate saving the average customer £12 on their bill, for the next two years, worth a total of £600 million.</p><a class="anchor" name="14011655000027"> </a><p class="tabletext">Reducing the cost of the Energy Company Obligation (ECO), an insulation scheme delivered by major energy suppliers.  <br/>

We are making sure that consumers are on the cheapest tariff with their supplier that is in line with their preferences with no one left behind on poor value out of date tariffs. Consumers will be provided with personalised information on the projected annual cost of their energy and will be told if their supplier has a tariff available which would be cheaper for them. These reforms of the retail market will put the power back into the hands of consumers, and help them to shop around for better deals.
